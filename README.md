## NOTE FOR DEVELOPERS

This project uses [CPAL](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal) as dependencies. it also uses ASIO features. follow the setup instruction for ASIO in their [github](https://github.com/RustAudio/cpal) so it can be built. In addition, currently it uses Windows as the development environment. When the app is near complete, we will implement features for Android. Linux support is currently not available since handling audio host in Linux is more difficult than in Windows.
